# Overview
## Kepler-TESS Dataset
It's a combined dataset, based on shared features, that contains both samples from Kepler and TESS (NASA Archives).
No additional work on dataset wasn't done. 

Train-test ratio is 5:1
## Algorithms
At the end, I use ensemble (baggin) of two algorithms: XGB and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
Tuned using Grid Search.
